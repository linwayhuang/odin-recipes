# odin-recipes

This project is about creating a website that consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes.

In order to do this, we will create an HTML file that contain the boiler plate template. It will also have the recipe title, headings, lists.

It might link to internal/external links for reference and might have images of the dishs. I will make sure the images is optimized for my website. Specifically, I might use JPEG which is good for photos. PNG can also be used if I think that the website would be viewed in different device types.

After that, I will push my project to Github using the workflow I have learnt in this curriculum.
