        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>

            <li>Meanwhile, melt butter in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Stir in green onions and garlic; cook for 1 minute. Stir in shrimp and scallops; cook for 3 minutes, then reduce the heat to medium-low.</li>
            <li>Pour in half-and-half and season with salt and pepper; stir constantly and bring to a simmer, making sure it does not boil. Gradually stir in 1/2 cup Parmesan; cook and stir for 1 more minute, then remove from the heat.</li>
            <li>Drain pasta. Add to the skillet and toss with sauce until thoroughly coated. Sprinkle remaining Parmesan over top and serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
